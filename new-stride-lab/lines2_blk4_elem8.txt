**************************************************************

Testing on 8 array elements each of size 4 bytes with stride 1.
Total array size is 32 bytes.

Elements in the array are accessed with write/read pairs.
This is done first on element[0], then element [1] and so on.
The entire process is repeated 4 times.

No sum of array elements was maintained. All simulated cache 
traffic was from array accesses.

Total element accesses: 64  (32 read and 32 write)
Total bytes accessed: 256

          Aggregate Cache and Performance Statistics
==============================================================

Simulated Cache Characteristics:
--------------------------------

Lines=2  Associativity=1 (direct mapped)  Block_size=4
Total cache size is: 8 bytes

The simulated cache is a "write-back" type: dirty blocks are not written
to memory until evicted, at which time a "write_for_eviction"
is recorded. When a line is written partially, then a
"read_for_write" accounts the need to read the line from
memory before updating it.

Performance Results:
--------------------

Accesses=64  Hits=32 (50.0%)
Read Misses=0 (0.0%) Write Misses=32 (100.0%)  Evictions=30
Reads=32  Writes=32  Reads_for_writes=0  Writes_for_evictions=30
Dirty blocks remaining=2

Time for hits=32ns  Time for memory reads=0ns
Time for memory writes (including flushing dirties)=4.16us
Estimated total memory access time:   With caching=4.19us   No caching=7.36us
Speedup: 1.8x
